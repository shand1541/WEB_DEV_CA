•	A prototype Online Gaming Portal application is required for demonstration. You are tasked with building this web application using Servlets, JDBC and MySQL.
•	When a player registers for the Online Gaming Portal (with their chosen gamer tag and password), they are automatically given 500 game credits.
•	Players must register by providing a gamer tag and password (get them to enter the password twice) that is verified by the program (not the webpage or JavaScript) to ensure both password entries match exactly.
•	Players can then log in and view how many game credits they currently have. They can choose to spend credits or add more credits.
•	Players may continue earning credits freely, but they cannot spend credits if doing so would make their balance go below zero.
•	After a player earns or spends credits, the system should display a personalised message showing their gamer tag and updated game credit balance on screen to finish.
